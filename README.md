# Multi-Decadal Spatial-Temporal Changes in Total Phosphorus Concentration in U.S. Rivers

## Overview
Total phosphorus (TP) concentration significantly impacts river ecosystems, yet its dynamics remain poorly understood in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). This study leverages **remote sensing** and **machine learning** to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of TP across U.S. rivers.

## Key Highlights
- **CLEAR-TP Database**: We developed the **C**ONUSâ€™s **L**andsat-based **E**stimation and **A**ssessment of **R**iverine **TP** (**CLEAR-TP**) database.
- **Coverage**: The database spans **33,497 river reaches** (a total of **107,000 km in length**) from **1984 to 2018**.
- **Approach**: Combines **remote sensing** technologies with **machine learning** algorithms for TP estimation.
