The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding would be a high-volume release of water from the dam’s spillways during significant storm events.  To maintain the structural integrity of the dam when the water level in the reservoir gets high, the spillways release water to the Raystown Branch Juniata River.  The amount of water being released could be great enough to cause flooding in downstream communities.  Such higher releases from the spillways could create conditions similar to how the river might behave if the dam did not exist.

There are also unlikely, but far more devastating scenarios involving breach of the dam that would produce significant flooding.  This could involve situations such as: a rare, extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach of the dam; or  unexpected behavior of seepage through the dam, eroding soil from within the embankment and leading to a breach of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  Huntingdon, Mapleton, Mt. Union, Lewistown, Shirleysburg, and adjacent communities are in the most immediate danger in the event of a flood.  Other communities along the Juniata River would also be impacted.

In any of the scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overflowing levees and destroying buildings and key infrastructure. Those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.  In the less likely dam breach scenarios, the water depth, property damage, and lives lost would likely be far greater.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Raystown Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities.  The dam is well-maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events.  USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with Federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur to provide information for any necessary flood warnings.","1",-78.006931008,40.433897804,"2196","2195",1.876000000000000,"7495","7515","4688453",2008/07/22,Medium,"1193174",Raystown Branch Juniata River,0.098000000000000,"02050303000994",With Digitized,"120049789",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.001127159599814,3.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,200018340.000000000000000,200018341.000000000000000,200008223.000000029802322,200008159.000000000000000,298.127000000000010,200004599.000000029802322,2083.295000000000073,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,200008159.000000000000000,200008249.000000000000000,200008159.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,200008201.000000000000000,91.095330000000004,92.182940000000002,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.053100000000000,2482.604100000000017,2482.604100000000017,0.000000000000000,0.003630594494410,18.097763854899998,,-9998.000000000000000,18407.000000000000000,18407.000000000000000,18407.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.097999997437000,1080.508000000000038,1.015720000000000,1177.931000000000040,1.020690000000000,1268.911000000000058,1.024990000000000,790.301000000000045,0.907480000000000,1044.926999999999907,0.976780000000000,1258.951999999999998,1.022000000000000,851.302000000000021,0.931610000000000,1167.743999999999915,1.017410000000000,1886.531999999999925,1.192960000000000,2401.181999999999789,1.389250000000000,2935.329999999999927,1.465090000000000,2641.159999999999854,1.366000000000000,2404.313000000000102,1.390000000000000,2498.347000000000207,1.370200000000000,2371.735000000000127,1.307270000000000,1634.290999999999940,1.189530000000000,1181.859999999999900,1.021950000000000,1500.625000000000000,1.091740000000000,906.438999999999965,0.952720000000000,707.730000000000018,0.851860000000000,969.479000000000042,0.929550000000000,533.197000000000003,0.794510000000000,346.821000000000026,0.680510000000000,544.714000000000055,0.765750000000000,321.262000000000000,0.679840000000000,282.004000000000019,0.641800000000000,321.552999999999997,0.654090000000000,257.834000000000003,0.638900000000000,247.395999999999987,0.619410000000000,383.184000000000026,0.687830000000000,333.329000000000008,0.687190000000000,315.819999999999993,0.662460000000000,590.802000000000021,0.785910000000000,1134.712999999999965,1.034350000000000,812.231999999999971,0.893090000000000,916.677999999999997,0.911350000000000,1404.516000000000076,1.121410000000000,1631.230999999999995,1.155110000000000,1401.713999999999942,1.063880000000000,,,,02a,"02","1","4688455",Mixed,,"1",53.6672751651306,-8683691.83837922,4929196.91880462,-8683701.80502007,4929144.18511051

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

The assessment characterizes the risk of the project as low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  During large storm events, Hartwell Dam’s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  Hartwell’s spillway moves water from Hartwell Lake to the immediately downstream Richard B. Russell Lake.  Russell’s Lake can contain some of the water, but the excess will be passed by Russell’s spillway to the immediately downstream J. Strom Thurmond Lake.  Just downstream of Thurmond Dam and Lake is a large population of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  Thurmond Dam is able to aid in mitigation of flooding of this downstream population by slowing down releases and allowing time for the city to begin preliminary evacuations and set Augusta Levee closures.  During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through Hartwell’s, Russell’s, and Thurmond’s spillways to prevent the lakes from reaching the top of the dams.  These rare events will result in river flows that could overtop the Augusta Levee and impact widespread areas downstream of the dam with dangerous flood waters.  It should be noted that Hartwell’s spillway gates have only been opened four times due to flooding, and the amount of flow passed through the dam has been minimal.  Hartwell Dam is well maintained and has historically performed well with no issues of immediate concern.  However, there is a slight chance that high lake levels may result in a breach of one of the embankments resulting in deep and swift downstream flooding.  This is an unlikely event, but one that should be considered as a possibility.","USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers and project personnel perform regular inspections of the dam and evaluate the dam’s instrumentation.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  The frequency of the inspections and instrumentation checks increases as the Hartwell Lake pool level rises in order to detect and identify any potential dam safety issues.  Periodic training is conducted with Hartwell Dam project personnel.  This training is to help project personnel, that are at the site on a daily basis, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.   Additionally, USACE works closely with Augusta-Richmond County during flood events.  The USACE operations plan for the downstream Thurmond Dam requires a stepped spillway release during major flood events and prospective/impending dam failure events.  This allows time for Augusta-Richmond County to close gate structures within the levee and to set levee stoplog closures before the full, required spillway releases are commenced.","1",-82.821427926,34.3577582770001,"4301","4300",1.948000000000000,"8335","9344","11737637",2009/09/14,Medium,"1253486",Savannah River,0.478000000000000,"03060103001641",With Digitized,"11750935",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.004723367445602,1.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,250084656.000000000000000,250084663.000000000000000,250009346.000000029802322,250003618.000000000000000,456.134999999999991,250003618.000000000000000,4522.270999999999731,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,250003618.000000000000000,250009389.000000000000000,250003618.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,250009304.000000000000000,47.818980000000003,60.584769999999999,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.222300000000000,5427.152100000000246,5427.152100000000246,0.000000000000000,0.015189709157000,45.217117884099999,,-9998.000000000000000,14467.000000000000000,14467.000000000000000,14467.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.477999985218048,4692.349000000000160,1.203360000000000,4092.387000000000171,1.193490000000000,4176.404999999999745,1.194950000000000,7968.927999999999884,1.494000000000000,5716.471999999999753,1.365380000000000,5791.979000000000269,1.363080000000000,8024.498999999999796,1.498380000000000,6122.853000000000065,1.404630000000000,6167.051999999999680,1.398810000000000,8576.415999999999258,1.541160000000000,6477.801999999999680,1.437930000000000,6542.319999999999709,1.433550000000000,6057.635000000000218,1.333340000000000,5199.925000000000182,1.313530000000000,5572.916000000000167,1.341700000000000,4614.417999999999665,1.195430000000000,3820.380999999999858,1.161750000000000,4141.203999999999724,1.190980000000000,2820.847000000000207,0.991430000000000,3366.880000000000109,1.106370000000000,3567.898999999999887,1.123830000000000,1838.878999999999905,0.852610000000000,2551.735000000000127,0.997140000000000,2709.340000000000146,1.012940000000000,1687.148999999999887,0.828280000000000,4035.860000000000127,1.186980000000000,3742.277999999999793,1.144760000000000,1959.954999999999927,0.871350000000000,3112.702999999999975,1.073790000000000,2467.275000000000091,0.978780000000000,2411.106999999999971,0.936810000000000,2750.181000000000040,1.025090000000000,2112.902000000000044,0.925800000000000,4266.672999999999774,1.159280000000000,2289.103000000000065,0.958540000000000,2231.318999999999960,0.943940000000000,6112.667999999999665,-9998.000000000000000,3739.065000000000055,-9998.000000000000000,3847.280999999999949,-9998.000000000000000,,,,03b,03N,"1","11737651",River,,"1",69.7534217545266,-9219639.1839394,4076941.98161995,-9219648.72289423,4076872.88351443

Russell Dam in May 2017.  The assessment characterizes the risk of the project as very low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of downstream flooding.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  During large storm events, Russell Dam’s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  Russell’s spillway moves water from the Russell Lake to the immediately downstream J. Strom Thurmond Lake.  Just downstream of Thurmond Dam and Lake is a large population of the city of Augusta, Georgia.  Thurmond Dam is able to aid in mitigation of flooding of this downstream population by slowing down releases and allowing time for the city to conduct preliminary evacuations and set Augusta Levee closures.    During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through Russell’s and Thurmond’s spillways to prevent the lakes from reaching the top of the dams.  These rare events will result in river flows that could overtop the Augusta Levee and impact widespread areas downstream of the dam with dangerous flood waters.  It is noted that Russell’s spillway gates have never been opened due to flooding; all inflows to the lake have always been mitigated by passing water through the generators, however this may not always be the case.  Russell Dam is well maintained and has historically performed well with no issues of immediate concern.  However, there is a slight chance that a significant earthquake event may result in a breach of one of the embankments, or a failure of a part of the concrete dam structure.  This could result in deep and swift downstream flooding.  This is an unlikely event, but one that should be considered as a possibility.","USACE is continuously taking action to prepare for emergency incidents.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE engineers and project personnel perform regular inspections of the dam and evaluate the dam’s instrumentation.  These inspections and instrumentation evaluations are used to assess how the dam is performing.  The frequency of the inspections and instrumentation checks increases as the Russell Lake level rises in order to detect and identify any potential dam safety issues.  Periodic training is conducted with Russell Dam project personnel.  This training is to help project personnel, that are at the site on a daily basis, to identify the early warning signs of a potential issue with the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.   Additionally, USACE works closely with Augusta-Richmond County during flood events.  The USACE operations plan for the downstream Thurmond Dam requires a stepped spillway release during major flood events and prospective/impending dam failure events.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

The classification was driven by the condition of concrete bulkheads in the powerhouse.  Structural modifications to address this issue were completed in 2020 and Mobile District presently considers project dam safety risk to be low.  The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities.  However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk.  Lanett, AL and West Point, GA are located nearby about 3 miles downstream of the dam.  During large storm events, the dam’s spillway gates will be opened to keep the reservoir level below the top of the spillway gates.  As the gates rise open, the flow in the river downstream is increased and more water is allowed to be held in the reservoir.  During an extreme storm event, an exceedingly large flow may need to be passed through the spillway to prevent the lake from reaching the top of the dam and downstream flooding will occur.  In the highly unlikely event of a dam failure, flood waters would be very swift and deep and cause catastrophic flooding, widespread economic impacts, and life loss, particularly in the vicinity of West Point, GA and Lanett, AL and have severe impacts downstream in communities such as Phenix City, AL: and Columbus, GA.  Key infrastructure along the river would be damaged or destroyed and historic flooding would occur all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, impacting the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.","USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

The classification is driven by presence of limestone cavities on the rim of the reservoir that could enlarge over time and potentially destabilize portions of the dam.  USACE completed a risk assessment in 2020 and has classified the risks associated with the Jim Woodruff as Moderate.  The classification is driven by presence of limestone at the site with cavities that could enlarge over time and potentially destabilize portions of the dam.  If a breach were to occur, flooding would occur in the floodplain, with flood damage and potential for life loss.  In the event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be in flood-prone communities downstream of the dam to the vicinity of Blountstown, FL.","USACE is continuously working to manage the risk to the public.  This includes sharing inundation mapping with local emergency managers and periodically updating the Emergency Action Plan   USACE regularly inspects and monitors the dam and dam instruments to check the condition of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect problems.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

The dam was found to be well-constructed and well-maintained and is expected to be reliable during major floods.  The dam could possibly be damaged or fail due to a nearby major earthquake of a magnitude that has not been experienced before in the area.  If this unlikely scenario were to occur flood waters would be extremely swift and deep and cause flooding downstream, economic impacts, and potentially loss of life.  In the unlikely event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be along the riverfront downstream of the dam, in areas of Tuscaloosa and Northport, Alabama.  Key infrastructure along the river could be damaged or destroyed and historic flooding on the river would occur to the vicinity of Demopolis, Alabama.","USACE is continuously working to manage the risk to the public.  This includes sharing flooding maps with state and county emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to assess the condition of the dam.  The frequency of these checks increases when the lake level rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

As a result of this risk assessment, USACE determined that the project is characterized as having a low risk of causing loss of pool that could impact navigation.  A breach of the dam is not expected to have the potential to result in loss of life.

The risk assessment identified (3) primary risk factors. The first risk factor involves seepage failure associated with the privately-owned access embankment. The second risk factor is associated with instability of the concrete dam due to scour.  The third risk factor is mechanical failure of the gate. If a failure was to occur, flow is expected to remain within the existing river channel.  However, the ability to regulate flow would be lost.","To ensure the continuous operation of Little Kaukauna Lock and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.  USACE staff are onsite several times each week to adjust the gates and check conditions of the structure, while USACE performs annual inspections reports to ensure the dam is performing as expected.  USACE makes regular contact with the State and the hydropower company to ensure awareness of any changes in the condition of the structure, and both of those agencies complete their own inspections and assessments.  Emergency Action Plans exist so that there is a plan in place to coordinate between the partners and population at risk.  Discharges from Lake Winnebago, which then pass through Little Kaukauna Lock and Dam, are updated daily and communicated to the public at https://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Water-Management/Lake-Winnebago/.

To proactively address concerns with the dam, USACE replaced the walkway over the sluiceway and repainted the gate steel as part of the gate hoist renovations in 2003.

As a result of this risk assessment, USACE determined that the project is characterized as having a low risk of causing loss of pool that could impact navigation and hydropower.  A breach of the dam is not expected to have the potential to result in loss of life.

The risk assessment identified (3) primary risk factors. The first risk factor involves instability of a masonry wall at the south end of the earthen embankment.  The second risk factor involves seepage through the earthen embankment.  The third risk factor is instability of the concrete dam.  If a failure was to occur, flow is expected to remain within the existing river channel.  However, the ability to generate power and regulate flow would be lost.","To ensure the continuous operation of DePere Lock and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.  USACE staff are onsite several times each week to adjust the gates and check conditions of the structure, while USACE performs annual inspections reports to ensure the dam is performing as expected.  USACE makes regular contact with the State and the hydropower company to ensure awareness of any changes in the condition of the structure, and both of those agencies complete their own inspections and assessments.  Emergency Action Plans exist so that there is a plan in place to coordinate between the partners and population at risk.  Discharges from Lake Winnebago, which then pass through DePere Lock and Dam, are updated daily and communicated to the public at https://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Water-Management/Lake-Winnebago/.

To proactively address concerns with the dam, USACE replaced right spillway walkway and piers in 2020 and the gates in 2011.  Repairs to the embankment have been made most recently in 2015 and 2019. Project staff regularly perform other routine maintenance.  USACE transferred the lock to the State in 2004, who rehabilitated it in 2007 and reestablished the hand-operated lockage function for in-season navigation.  Sinkholes have occasionally developed on the earthen embankment, which have been quickly backfilled with State and USACE cooperation.  These measures have increased the reliability of the structure and long-term resilience of the dam.","1",-88.0638031559999,44.448315043,"7525","7522",7.203000000000000,"3678","3686","12006773",2009/01/08,Medium,"1565232",Fox River,7.203000000000000,"04030204000019",With Digitized,"120049201",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.073865411611911,1.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,90022212.000000000000000,90022208.000000000000000,90003582.999999985098839,90003575.000000000000000,9.090999999999999,90003575.000000000000000,9279.245999999999185,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,90003585.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003581.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,45.310229999999997,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,14.470200000000000,16070.280000000000655,15837.522000000000844,0.000000000000000,0.158607619642000,0.180531540432000,,-9998.000000000000000,17803.000000000000000,17888.000000000000000,17839.000000000000000,0.000068020000000,"0",,7.203000068664552,3762.076000000000022,1.706710000000000,4585.476999999999862,1.729310000000000,4397.219000000000051,1.724490000000000,1119.375999999999976,1.043010000000000,2656.246000000000095,1.371710000000000,3844.242000000000189,1.626960000000000,566.245000000000005,0.819950000000000,2567.204000000000178,1.352630000000000,3964.461999999999989,1.648700000000000,2707.048999999999978,1.482510000000000,4337.654999999999745,1.688000000000000,5036.814000000000306,1.830380000000000,13090.398999999999432,3.019560000000000,13646.933000000000902,2.843970000000000,6407.154999999999745,2.037840000000000,7722.055999999999585,2.356920000000000,4833.689999999999600,1.769650000000000,5632.828999999999724,1.923510000000000,4436.176999999999680,1.834610000000000,3309.673999999999978,1.503430000000000,5481.239999999999782,1.900280000000000,2750.096000000000004,1.492380000000000,2954.378000000000156,1.433490000000000,4244.134000000000015,1.698100000000000,1968.541999999999916,1.299790000000000,2573.579999999999927,1.354000000000000,3176.588999999999942,1.499930000000000,1733.365999999999985,1.235020000000000,2542.496000000000095,1.347280000000000,3466.126999999999953,1.556420000000000,2089.478999999999814,1.331670000000000,1877.441000000000031,1.192770000000000,3969.396000000000186,1.649580000000000,4744.613999999999578,1.890070000000000,3470.597000000000207,1.533940000000000,4712.179000000000087,1.777480000000000,2240.278999999999996,1.370250000000000,3141.110000000000127,1.470710000000000,4159.453000000000429,1.683310000000000,,,,04d,"04","1","12006765",River,,"1",73.9186547144098,-9803217.72509028,5535084.12368357,-9803291.39668767,5535078.08520263

These measures have increased the reliability of the structure and long-term resilience of the dam.","1",-88.19802261,44.316222478,"7529","7530",4.324000000000000,"3678","3695","12006813",2009/01/08,Medium,"1565232",Fox River,0.390000000000000,"04030204000037",With Digitized,"120049201",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.004686602533862,1.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,90022230.000000000000000,90022227.000000000000000,90003606.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,31.420999999999999,90003575.000000000000000,8984.154000000000451,1.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,90003609.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003595.000000000000000,31.924550000000000,36.836109999999998,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.311400000000000,15799.621999999999389,15566.863999999999578,0.000000000000000,0.006132285434670,0.675104845876000,,-9998.000000000000000,18199.000000000000000,18299.000000000000000,18266.000000000000000,0.000846150000000,"0",,0.389999985694885,3712.820999999999913,2.388590000000000,4526.239999999999782,2.422240000000000,4337.981999999999971,2.414980000000000,1115.003999999999905,1.406630000000000,2646.208999999999833,1.898000000000000,3833.530999999999949,2.281130000000000,563.397000000000048,1.072710000000000,2555.295000000000073,1.868760000000000,3951.788000000000011,2.313220000000000,2657.630000000000109,2.050190000000000,4285.644000000000233,2.361810000000000,4984.082000000000335,2.576150000000000,12876.625000000000000,4.334600000000000,13433.654000000000451,4.074970000000001,6197.704999999999927,2.854360000000000,7607.619999999999891,3.353020000000000,4765.097999999999956,2.480760000000000,5563.530999999999949,2.712530000000000,4368.894000000000233,2.576320000000000,3262.181999999999789,2.084830000000000,5431.954999999999927,2.682170000000000,2709.092999999999847,2.068020000000000,2910.295999999999822,1.980360000000000,4198.966999999999643,2.378860000000000,1939.214999999999918,1.781790000000000,2535.934999999999945,1.862470000000000,3138.355000000000018,2.082290000000000,1711.531999999999925,1.687250000000000,2512.664999999999964,1.854890000000000,3435.806999999999789,2.169670000000000,2074.922000000000025,1.835680000000000,1866.837999999999965,1.629180000000000,3957.958000000000084,2.314880000000000,4721.091000000000349,2.671630000000000,3455.429999999999836,2.139950000000000,4696.247000000000298,2.505640000000000,2231.144999999999982,1.895700000000000,3128.530999999999949,2.045800000000000,4146.176999999999680,2.364990000000000,,,,04d,"04","1","12006803",River,,"1",7.11295087488235,-9818158.96591883,5514509.46459377,-9818163.55518728,5514504.03019545

As a result of this risk assessment, USACE determined that the project is characterized as having a very low risk of causing loss of pool that could impact navigation or hydropower.  A breach of the dam is not expected to have the potential to result in loss of life.

The risk assessment identified three (3) primary risk factors.  The first involves failure of the concrete wall along the north embankment and the other two involve failure of the tainter gates, although USACE reduced these factors with the recent repairs discussed in the Risk Management Measures section.  If a failure were to occur, flow is expected to remain within the existing river channel.  However, the ability to generate power and regulate flow would be lost.","To ensure the continuous operation of Kaukauna Locks and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.  USACE staff are onsite several times each week to adjust the gates and check conditions of the structure, while USACE performs annual inspections reports to ensure the dam is performing as expected.  USACE makes regular contact with the State and the hydropower company to ensure awareness of any changes in the condition of the structure, and both of those agencies complete their own inspections and assessments.  Emergency Action Plans exist so that there is a plan in place to coordinate between the partners and population at risk.  Discharges from Lake Winnebago, which then pass through Kaukauna Locks and Dam, are updated daily and communicated to the public at https://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Water-Management/Lake-Winnebago/.

To proactively address concerns with the dam, USACE replaced the tainter gates and pier repair along the gated spillway in 2020 and replaced the spillway piers along with the walkway in 2015.  Project staff regularly perform other routine maintenance.  USACE transferred the locks to the State in 2004, who rehabilitated it in 2007 and reestablished the hand-operated lockage function for in-season navigation.  These measures have increased the reliability of the structure and long-term resilience of the dam.","1",-88.271066532,44.281139716,"7533","7532",3.626000000000000,"3678","3706","12006917",2009/01/08,Medium,"1565232",Fox River,0.015000000000000,"04030204000039",With Digitized,"120049201",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.000158605057671,1.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,90022283.000000000000000,90022255.000000000000000,90003629.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,39.683000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,8907.353999999999360,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,90003639.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003624.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,2.757850000000000,1.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000900000000000,15715.546000000000276,15482.788000000000466,0.000000000000000,0.000127535531891,0.836475963350000,,-9998.000000000000000,19121.000000000000000,19213.000000000000000,19121.000000000000000,0.061333330000000,"0",,0.014999999664724,3697.418999999999869,4.414100000000001,4507.713999999999942,4.480530000000000,4319.456000000000131,4.466130000000000,1113.637999999999920,2.479370000000000,2643.072999999999865,3.450690000000000,3830.186000000000149,4.209020000000000,562.392000000000053,1.818840000000000,2551.092999999999847,3.392140000000000,3947.347999999999956,4.271930000000000,2641.382000000000062,3.742590000000000,4268.470999999999549,4.361440000000000,4966.684000000000196,4.786100000000000,12810.244000000000597,8.250690000000002,13367.395000000000437,7.739240000000000,6132.636000000000422,5.316640000000000,7571.792000000000371,6.315810000000000,4743.613999999999578,4.595080000000000,5541.827000000000226,5.054360000000000,4347.939999999999600,4.783070000000000,3247.384000000000015,3.813750000000000,5416.599000000000160,4.997100000000000,2696.657999999999902,3.780570000000000,2896.927999999999884,3.607500000000000,4185.261999999999716,4.397040000000000,1930.172000000000025,3.215660000000000,2524.324000000000069,3.374920000000000,3126.561000000000149,3.810470000000000,1704.749000000000024,3.030120000000000,2503.393000000000029,3.361390000000000,3426.382999999999811,3.984960000000000,2070.400999999999840,3.325970000000000,1863.541999999999916,2.918500000000000,3954.402999999999793,4.275690000000000,4713.641999999999825,4.979130000000000,3450.626000000000204,3.928580000000000,4691.204999999999927,4.652460000000000,2228.264999999999873,3.446040000000000,3124.563999999999851,3.742710000000000,4141.993999999999687,4.374540000000000,,,,04d,"04","1","12006859",River,,"1",14.9028160092593,-9826290.17789877,5509052.78291114,-9826282.46703538,5509065.53581319

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

As a result of this risk assessment, USACE determined that the project is characterized as having a very low risk of causing inadvertent flooding or loss of pool that could impact navigation or hydropower.

The risk assessment identified two (2) primary risk factors.  The first is seepage under or through the earth embankment on the left bank just upstream of the lock. If this were to occur, flooding of a mobile home community could result, as well as, loss of power generation and ability to regulate flow.  The second is scour downstream of the concrete dam, expanding where it could affect the foundation of the dam and impact the functioning of the gates.  This could result in the loss of the ability to generate power and the ability to regulate flow.  This risk factor would not result in additional downstream flooding as all flow would be expected to remain in the existing river channel.","To ensure the continuous operation of Cedars Lock and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.  USACE staff are onsite several times each week to adjust the gates and check conditions of the structure, while USACE performs annual inspections reports to ensure the dam is performing as expected.  USACE makes regular contact with the State and the hydropower company to ensure awareness of any changes in the condition of the structure, and both of those agencies complete their own inspections and assessments.  Emergency Action Plans exist so that there is a plan in place to coordinate between the partners and population at risk.  Discharges from Lake Winnebago, which then pass through Cedars Lock and Dam, are updated daily and communicated to the public at https://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Water-Management/Lake-Winnebago/ .
To proactively address concerns with the dam, USACE replaced the gates and rehabilitated the concrete piers in 2011.  Project staff regularly perform other routine maintenance.  USACE transferred the lock to the State in 2004, who rehabilitated it in 2007 and reestablished the hand-operated lockage function for in-season navigation.  These measures have increased the reliability of the structure and long-term resilience of the dam.","1",-88.3326299999999,44.2789000000001,"7535","7534",7.066000000000000,"3678","3712","12006873",2009/01/08,Medium,"1565232",Fox River,0.826000000000000,"04030204000042",With Digitized,"120049201",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.009338253732315,1.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,90022262.000000000000000,90022261.000000000000000,90003665.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,45.862000000000002,90003575.000000000000000,8863.893000000000029,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,90003667.000000000000000,90003575.000000000000000,90003663.000000014901161,2.000000000000000,90003662.000000000000000,13.961259999999999,19.552900000000001,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.419400000000000,15676.036000000000058,15443.278000000000247,0.000000000000000,0.010354841773200,0.930265037046000,,-9998.000000000000000,20390.000000000000000,20743.000000000000000,20390.000000000000000,0.004273600000000,"0",,0.825999975204468,3690.233000000000175,2.995020000000000,4499.069999999999709,3.038490000000000,4310.813000000000102,3.029060000000000,1113.106999999999971,1.730110000000000,2641.853000000000065,2.366200000000000,3828.867999999999938,2.863060000000000,562.053999999999974,1.297480000000000,2549.677000000000135,2.327750000000000,3945.820999999999913,2.904200000000000,2634.262999999999920,2.554710000000000,4260.935000000000400,2.960780000000000,4959.042999999999665,3.239150000000000,12778.605999999999767,5.504090000000000,13335.809999999999491,5.169720000000000,6101.609000000000378,3.580250000000000,7554.798999999999978,4.238800000000001,4733.422999999999774,3.113100000000000,5531.533000000000357,3.414200000000000,4337.978000000000065,3.235920000000000,3240.347000000000207,2.601870000000000,5409.300000000000182,3.377570000000000,2690.813000000000102,2.580190000000000,2890.643999999999778,2.466920000000000,4178.819999999999709,2.984500000000000,1925.836999999999989,2.210500000000000,2518.759000000000015,2.314710000000000,3120.909999999999854,2.600250000000000,1701.561999999999898,2.089460000000000,2499.034999999999854,2.306360000000000,3421.954000000000178,2.715100000000000,2068.275999999999840,2.283950000000000,1861.991999999999962,2.017340000000000,3952.731000000000222,2.906610000000000,4710.615999999999985,3.366870000000000,3448.673999999999978,2.679020000000000,4689.140999999999622,3.153340000000000,2227.094999999999800,2.363100000000000,3122.954000000000178,2.557370000000000,4140.282000000000153,2.971360000000000,,,,04d,"04","1","12006877",River,,"1",0.212501810207171,-9833143.39203064,5508704.53333851,-9833143.29771363,5508704.72376257

A breach of the dam is not expected to have the potential to result in loss of life.
The risk assessment identified three (3) primary risk factors. The first two involve structural failure of the masonry wall between the dam and powerhouse or between the powerhouse and lock. The third is scour downstream of the concrete dam that could lead to failure of a tainter gate, although USACE reduced this factor with the recent repairs discussed in the Risk Management Measures section.  If a failure occurs, minor flooding may affect up to 3 commercial structures downstream of the dam. Additionally, the ability to generate power and regulate flow would be lost.","To ensure the continuous operation of Upper Appleton Lock and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.

As a result of this risk assessment, USACE determined that the project is characterized as having a very low risk of causing loss of pool that could impact navigation and hydropower.  A breach of the dam is not expected to have the potential to result in loss of life.

The risk assessment identified (2) potential risk drivers. Both of these risk drivers involve seepage through the embankment south of the concrete spillway at two distinct locations.  If a failure was to occur, flow is expected to remain within the existing river channel.  However, the ability to generate power and regulate flow would be lost.","To ensure the continuous operation of Lower Appleton Lock and Dam, the partners that own and operate the dam work together to monitor conditions of the structure.  USACE staff are onsite several times each week to adjust the gates and check conditions of the structure, while USACE performs annual inspections reports to ensure the dam is performing as expected.  USACE makes regular contact with the State and the hydropower company to ensure awareness of any changes in the condition of the structure, and both of those agencies complete their own inspections and assessments.  Emergency Action Plans exist so that there is a plan in place to coordinate between the partners and population at risk.  Discharges from Lake Winnebago, which then pass through Lower Appleton Lock and Dam, are updated daily and communicated to the public at https://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/Missions/Water-Management/Lake-Winnebago/.

To proactively address concerns with the dam, USACE replaced the tainter gates, repaired the piers, and added a walkway to the north side of the dam in 2021-2022. Project staff regularly perform other routine maintenance.  USACE transferred the lock to the State in 2004, who rehabilitated it in 2007 and reestablished the hand-operated lockage function for in-season navigation.

There are three primary risks associated with the dam: : (1) a flood that is so large it exceeds the dam's capacity to store water, (2) a large flood which causes the concrete to fail internally and (3) water seepage into the dam's rock foundation leading to instability and failure. In the case of an exceptionally large flood, water would flow over the spillway for the first time in the dam's history. Although unlikely, these potential failures could lead to a rapid, uncontrolled release of water from the dam. This release of water would result in catastrophic flooding, significant loss of life and economic impacts. Localities at most risk and their expected maximum flood depths are:  Villages of Mount Morris (35 feet), Avon (18 feet), and Scottsville (10 feet); city of Rochester (14 feet); and towns of Geneseo (29 feet), Irondequoit (14 feet), and Brighton (15 feet). The village of Mount Morris is at particular risk due to the limited warning time between a failure at the dam and the arrival of flood waters. 

In the event of a dam failure, under extremely high flow conditions, the New York State Canal Corporation-owned floodwall in Rochester will not prevent flooding in adjacent areas and bridges across the Genesee River will be flooded including the I-90, I-390, I-490 and I-590.","The USACE is continuously taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. Updated stability analyses are underway to determine if the seepage and concrete failure modes are possible and will determine if any remediation is required to reduce the risk to the public. The USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam. The frequency of these inspections increases as the pool behind the dam rises. This routine monitoring ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.","1",-77.9072318079999,42.73329398,"8155","8154",5.260000000000000,"3967","4284","15547231",2005/01/24,Medium,"970162",Genesee River,0.287000000000000,"04130002000005",With Digitized,"0",StreamRiver,"46006",0.003262235111890,1.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,90054043.999999985098839,90054279.999999985098839,90005563.000000000000000,90004410.999999985098839,108.361999999999995,90004410.999999985098839,1792.700000000000045,1.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90004410.999999985098839,90005590.999999985098839,90004410.999999985098839,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,90005535.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.120600000000000,2798.434000000000196,2798.434000000000196,0.000000000000000,0.010400794665400,3.113439678310000,,-9998.000000000000000,17690.000000000000000,17690.000000000000000,17690.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.287000000476837,1353.791999999999916,1.041710000000000,1672.828999999999951,1.054380000000000,1499.809999999999945,1.047820000000000,533.731999999999971,0.755740000000000,1297.555000000000064,0.960240000000000,1595.882000000000062,1.072600000000000,266.773000000000025,0.617930000000000,1282.517000000000053,0.956220000000000,1786.657999999999902,1.119820000000000,913.447999999999979,0.903450000000000,2129.846000000000004,1.156470000000000,2950.541000000000167,1.367490000000000,3689.726999999999862,1.557240000000000,4063.601000000000113,1.503510000000000,2937.023000000000138,1.364910000000000,2581.724999999999909,1.341530000000000,1693.538999999999987,1.059270000000000,1612.208000000000084,1.076740000000000,1719.569999999999936,1.141010000000000,1350.653000000000020,0.974270000000000,1230.396999999999935,0.974020000000000,932.129999999999995,0.909880000000000,1000.567999999999984,0.876210000000000,580.999000000000024,0.755270000000000,549.567999999999984,0.762730000000000,735.428999999999974,0.790570000000000,443.939000000000021,0.695780000000000,793.870000000000005,0.860720000000000,1228.872000000000071,0.941690000000000,628.936000000000035,0.774490000000000,1334.683999999999969,1.036190000000000,1305.776000000000067,0.962430000000000,942.946000000000026,0.886310000000000,1860.674999999999955,1.176610000000000,1521.186999999999898,1.017680000000000,1428.915999999999940,1.029050000000000,1078.028000000000020,0.958160000000000,1531.368999999999915,1.020190000000000,1815.384999999999991,1.126730000000000,,,,04a,"04","1","15548117",River,,"1",3.92153281648467,-8672593.37420272,5271464.17866878,-8672593.31713211,5271460.25755127

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

The assessment identified one scenario that could cause flooding.  If the Allegheny river reaches a sufficiently high level (between an annual probability of 1 in 100 and 1 in 500), the river could overtop, erode and destroy the dike on the left bank.  If this were to occur, a number of residences and an industrial facility would be swiftly flooded.  In the event of breach of the dike, the floodwater in the landward area could be swift and deep, damaging buildings and those caught unaware and/or unable to evacuate could perish.    

There is another scenario that could cause failure of the dam:  if the riverbed downstream of the dam were to erode sufficiently, a portion of the concrete dam could slide downstream and release the water in the pool behind the dam.  Although this scenario is very unlikely, it would most likely occur during a time of normal river levels.  If the pool upstream of the dam is released, river navigation would be halted, resulting in a loss of economic benefits to the region of more than 3 million dollars per year.  The economic damage would be temporary, until the upper pool could be restored to allow resumption of shipping and boat recreation.  Although this scenario is possible, the dam has performed well for over 80 years without incident and there are no indications that the downstream riverbed is eroding in a manner that would threaten the dam.  Failure of the Braeburn dike on the upstream left river bank could threaten the lives of those who live or work behind the dike.  However, the dam itself, which is at a lower level than the dike, lies entirely within the banks of the Allegheny River. Downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail and the upper pool was lost.","To ensure we are taking all steps to reduce the risk to the public and the economy, we will conduct emergency exercises with our external partners to improve communications and reactions in the event of an emergency that threatens the Braeburn Dike, the dam’s upper pool or may adversely affect navigation.  We regularly update our emergency action plan.  We will also communicate with the Coast Guard, the Waterways Association and the shipping industry to keep them aware of conditions at the dam and any changes to lock operations.  We will work with emergency managers to communicate the risk of flooding related to the Braeburn dike to residents and actions they can take to be prepared for evacuation.  We conduct routine monitoring and surveillance of the lock and dam, including periodic comprehensive inspections, the most recent of which was conducted in 2018.  Based on observations of possible riverbed erosion downstream of the dam after the 2018 inspection, USACE undertook a careful inspection of the area in 2020.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

Willow Island Locks and Dam purpose is to manage the pool elevation upstream and to permit navigation through the river. The dam cannot perform any flood risk reduction measures. Because of this, the projected life loss from failure of the dam is zero. There would however be large economic consequences if Willow Island Locks and Dam lost pool. The loss of navigation along the Ohio would devastate local industry. The loss of pool would also cause major slippage of the riverbank along the Ohio and it’s large tributaries between Willow Island Locks and Dam and Hannibal Locks and Dam upstream. This streambank erosion would cause roads and structures along the bank to be in jeopardy of slipping into the river.","Routine operations and maintenance of the project is ongoing. Although the consequences of a failure at Willow Island Locks and Dam is low, USACE still conducts regular inspections and maintenance of the structure to ensure risk remains minimal.","1",-81.3193120989999,39.3592595160001,"9165","9164",4.205000000000000,"17332","17874","15434078",2009/02/11,Medium,"425264",Ohio River,0.363000000000000,"05030201000024",With Digitized,"120049738",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.003978202319116,2.000000000000000,8.000000000000000,8.000000000000000,430086989.000000000000000,430086999.000000000000000,430000914.000000000000000,430000004.000000000000000,2869.297000000000025,350002977.000000000000000,56251.019999999996799,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,2.000000000000000,430000004.000000000000000,430000918.000000000000000,430000004.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,430000910.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,29.676279999999998,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.238500000000000,69689.089800000001560,69689.089800000001560,0.000000000000000,0.002773630735610,30.361174371099999,,-9998.000000000000000,17728.000000000000000,18185.000000000000000,17848.000000000000000,0.009283740000000,"0",,0.363000005483627,39302.146999999997206,4.914570000000000,36133.135999999998603,4.883310000000000,45520.171999999998661,4.969690000000000,27237.516999999999825,4.099620000000000,25354.858000000000175,4.098850000000000,53014.644000000000233,5.362620000000000,25050.433000000000902,3.934800000000000,18371.380000000001019,3.502830000000000,65138.241999999998370,5.946690000000000,58695.983999999996740,6.007890000000000,54521.944999999992433,6.000260000000000,76744.456999999994878,6.459610000000000,83160.627999999996973,7.166140000000000,65835.562000000005355,6.599650000000000,72611.429999999993015,6.281420000000000,62405.525000000001455,6.196410000000000,42959.129999999997381,5.323580000000000,46829.902000000001863,5.040440000000000,39045.436000000001513,4.898570000000000,26552.965000000000146,4.192930000000000,33578.875000000000000,4.274300000000000,23448.955999999998312,3.809790000000000,14126.980999999999767,3.086900000000000,24470.080000000001746,3.660870000000000,15350.680000000000291,3.104410000000000,12463.944999999999709,2.908120000000000,19693.132000000001426,3.295720000000000,20573.748999999999796,3.574830000000000,12125.143000000000029,2.870360000000000,18355.693999999999505,3.186210000000000,26340.787000000000262,4.032820000000000,11755.192999999999302,2.828550000000000,22915.615000000001601,3.546050000000000,45738.383000000001630,5.300850000000000,27556.970000000001164,4.270240000000001,40797.275000000001455,4.706300000000000,44840.841000000007625,5.248590000000000,40631.525000000001455,5.177410000000000,59139.989000000001397,5.664750000000000,,,,05d,"05","1","15434098",River,,"1",15.111391184501,-9052424.41463129,4773263.8472488,-9052430.87969056,4773277.50584141

Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

Flooding can still occur even if Bluestone Dam is operating as designed. There are rare but probable storms, like hurricanes, which cause more rainfall than Bluestone Dam can store safely. While hurricanes regularly occur in North Carolina, to affect Bluestone Dam, they would have to drop significant rainfall in the New River basin which is in the northwestern corner of the state, away from the coast. While this reduces the likelihood of a storm impacting this basin, in some rare occasions, conditions could lead to flows greater than 1 million cfs, which is greater than ten times Niagara Falls.

The dam’s primary and auxiliary spillways pass these events to keep Bluestone Dam from overtopping and failing. When passing these events, flooding is likely in all river-front communities in the New and Kanawha River valleys and potentially the Ohio River valley as well. Depending on the amount of water released during these events, significant damages to houses, buildings, factories, roads, bridges, power, and water supply may occur.

While rare events like these have not occurred to date, if they were to happen, water is likely to reach hillside to hillside quickly and be more than tens of feet deep depending on the location. In the unlikely event Bluestone Dam must pass these extreme waters, follow all directions from emergency officials, including evacuation orders. Failure to do so puts you and your family’s lives at risk.
Since 2000, USACE has made significant investments in Bluestone Dam to help ensure it continues to provide benefits to the public and significantly reduce the chance it would fail. These investments are scheduled to be completed by 2030. The remaining work is focused reinforcing the primary stilling basin to be able to safely pass extreme outflows. Modeling indicates that the primary spillway’s 23 feet deep stilling basin, cannot properly reduce the energy created from the crest gates releasing waters. The energy created by the water releases is likely to fail the primary stilling basin causing the bedrock beneath the dam to become unstable, which could cause the dam to fail.

This concern with the primary stilling basin is most likely to realize during the passage of rare storms when flooding is already occurring downstream. However, if the dam were to fail, the flooding downstream would dramatically increase. Specifically, warning times would be reduced, and the volume of water and debris carried by the releases would be more like a tidal wave or tsunami increasing the risk to life and property. In the unlikely event the dam was to fail during one of these extreme events, it is critical that you heed all evacuation orders immediately to protect your life.","USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with federal, state, and local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. USACE also works closely with state and federal emergency agencies to ensure awareness of rare storm events and potential impacts. All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components. USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase this monitoring during lake levels rises. This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

Significant construction, started in 2000, has increased the dam’s ability to safely store storm waters with the installation of hundreds of anchors as well as increase its ability to discharge extreme storm waters by adding an auxiliary stilling basin. Work continues to reinforce the primary stilling basin to safely pass rare storm events without failing the dam. Construction includes installing new concrete in the primary spillway’s, 23 feet deep stilling basin. This work includes protecting exposed rock with several feet of reinforced and anchored concrete and installing state of the art features, call super-cavitating baffles, to help calm the energy of extreme outflows and protect the dam’s integrity.

This incremental risk is mostly due to the potential for spillway erosion and uncontrolled release of the pool, as well as the relatively large population that would be at risk in the case that a dam breach were to occur. The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to the downstream communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Dams reduce but do not eliminate the risk of economic and environmental damages and loss of life from flood events. When a flood exceeds the reservoir's capacity, large amounts of water may have to be released that could cause damaging flooding downstream. A fully functioning dam could be overtopped when a rare, large flood occurs, or a dam could breach because of a deficiency, both of which pose risk of property damage and life loss. This means there will always be flood risk that has to be managed. To manage these risks USACE has a routine program that inspects and monitors its dams regularly.","There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day-to-day basis to help manage risk at Summersville Dam. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events. Supplementing these inspections, the dam has a specialized instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to continually evaluate the dam for changing conditions. Risk management and emergency response actions are being pursued through coordination with local emergency management entities along with dam safety training with USACE staff and local and state emergency responders. USACE implements short- and long-term actions, on a prioritized basis, when unacceptable risks are found at any of its dams.","1",-80.890672039,38.2223566370001,"9676","9678",2.123000000000000,"19182","19649","4548212",1999/07/30,Medium,"1551216",Gauley River,0.302000000000000,"05050005000131",With Digitized,"0",Connector,"33400",0.002724513979727,4.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,430035582.000000000000000,430035549.000000000000000,430005832.000000000000000,430004091.000000000000000,2915.192000000000007,350002977.000000000000000,1666.960000000000036,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,4.000000000000000,430004091.000000000000000,430005876.000000000000000,430004091.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,430005787.000000000000000,90.907280000000000,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.108000000000000,2083.132799999999861,2083.132799999999861,0.000000000000000,0.002903602845130,31.830078006000001,,-9998.000000000000000,42192.000000000000000,49980.000000000000000,42192.000000000000000,0.257880790000000,"0",,0.301999986171722,1911.626999999999953,3.937270000000000,1908.788000000000011,3.936830000000000,1992.635999999999967,3.949490000000000,1291.990999999999985,3.255710000000000,1701.315000000000055,3.721770000000000,2731.554999999999836,4.613360000000000,1316.655999999999949,3.285450000000000,1846.207000000000107,3.873170000000000,3008.213999999999942,4.839640000000000,2713.175000000000182,4.678820000000000,3031.032000000000153,4.946730000000000,3691.429999999999836,5.359850000000000,3248.585999999999785,5.117420000000000,2848.690999999999804,4.796410000000000,2512.570000000000164,4.426510000000001,2970.708999999999833,4.894410000000000,2360.356000000000222,4.369920000000000,2181.496999999999844,4.128850000000000,1925.339999999999918,3.951070000000000,1570.893000000000029,3.580230000000000,1377.684999999999945,3.301520000000000,1531.789999999999964,3.534570000000000,1145.347999999999956,3.074910000000000,960.730999999999995,2.780100000000000,1305.773999999999887,3.272360000000000,1215.473999999999933,3.163600000000000,983.864000000000033,2.811530000000000,1297.376999999999953,3.262220000000000,1083.444999999999936,2.994480000000000,745.695000000000050,2.468950000000000,1502.851000000000113,3.502060000000000,1111.644999999999982,3.031380000000000,1052.781999999999925,2.903160000000000,1882.147999999999911,3.907450000000000,1562.306000000000040,3.570720000000000,1805.673999999999978,3.763900000000000,1965.201999999999998,3.990930000000000,2043.949000000000069,4.071070000000000,2582.728999999999814,4.487180000000001,,,,05d,"05","1","4548132",Mixed,,"1",0.294030764030027,-9004708.42141849,4610885.14500044,-9004708.13206349,4610885.19722856

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

Roush Dam reduces the risk of flooding to downstream communities, however, the dam does not eliminate this potential flood risk.  Downstream of the dam are the Cities of Huntington, Andrews, Lagro, Wabash, Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and Terra Haute, Indiana along with numerous other small towns and communities along the Wabash River all the way to the Ohio River.  The most likely scenario for downstream flooding from the J.E. Roush Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam's gated spillway during major high water events.  When the water level in the reservoir gets above a set elevation, the spillway gates will be opened releasing water to the Wabash River downstream to relieve pressure on the dam and to avoid the potential of water flowing over the top of the dam.  The amount of water released could be great enough to cause flooding downstream.  Higher releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the river would behave if the dam did not exist as the amount of water released would be controlled to match the amount of water coming into the reservoir.  These releases could impact travel on State Route 5 (Warren Road), North Etna Road, State Route 9 (North Marion Road), and US 24 (Wabash Road) downstream of the dam.  In addition, as the reservoir level increases, flooding will also be occurring upstream of the dam as the pool enlarges and extends nearly to the City of Bluffton, Indiana, about 16 miles to the southeast of the dam and could impact some local roads.

There are also two unlikely, but more devastating scenarios, that could result in significant flooding:  1) erosion of the soil foundation under the dam during a period of high reservoir levels that could lead to a breach; or 2) an extreme rainfall event that could result in water flowing over the top of the earthen embankment of the dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach.  In either scenario, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir, flooding downstream communities.  The communities of Huntington and Andrews and other residences and businesses located in the valley below the dam would be in immediate danger if this were to occur.  Cities further downstream, including Wabash, Peru, Logansport, and Lafayette would also see large damaging flood conditions, but would have more warning time to respond.  In the two scenarios described above, the downstream floodwater would be swift and deep, overtopping levees, destroying buildings and key infrastructure, and those caught unaware and unable to evacuate could perish.","USACE is taking several steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the dam.  USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers, regularly conducts emergency exercises, and routinely updates the emergency action plan (EAP) for the dam.

Downstream of the dam are the Cities of Lagro, Wabash, Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and Terra Haute, Indiana along with numerous other small towns and communities along the Wabash River all the way to the Ohio River.  The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding from Salamonie Dam would be a high-volume release of water from the dam's spillway during significant storm events.  When the water level in the reservoir gets above the spillway sill, water is released to maintain the structural integrity of the dam.  The spillway bypasses flow away from the lower Salamonie River to discharge into the Wabash River upstream of the confluence of the 2 rivers.  Numerous local roads, such as County Road 100 S (East Salamonie Dam Road), E 50 S, and East Division Road could become impassable if water flows through the spillway.  The design of the spillway is to release less than or no more than equal to the amount of water coming into the reservoir.  Large releases from the spillway could create conditions similar to how the Wabash River might behave if the dam did not exist.  In addition, as the reservoir level increases, flooding will also be occurring upstream of the dam as the pool will enlarge and extend nearly to the town of Warren, Indiana, about 15 miles to the southeast of the dam.  This upstream flooding would likely impact several roads in between, including State Route 105, State Route 124, and State Route 9 (South Marion Road).

A very unlikely, but far more devasting scenario that would produce significant flooding would be an extreme rainfall event resulting in water flowing over the earthen dam, eroding the dam and leading to a breach.  If such an event occurs, an uncontrolled surge of water would flow out of the reservoir and flood downstream communities.  Lagro, IN is the closest community below the dam that would be in immediate danger of large damaging flood conditions, followed by Wabash, Peru, and Logansport.  The floodwaters would be swift and deep, overtopping levees, and destroying buildings and key infrastructure.  Those caught unaware and unable to evacuate could perish.  Other towns and cities along the Wabash River down to the Ohio River would also be impacted.","USACE is taking several steps to reduce the risk to the public.  USACE staff are continuously on-site to operate and maintain the dam.  USACE works closely with state and local emergency managers, regularly conducts emergency exercises, and routinely updates the emergency action plan (EAP) for the dam.  USACE also conducts rigorous inspection, monitoring, and surveillance of the dam, especially during high water events.  USACE also closely follows rainfall forecasts to determine when high water events may occur and provide information for any necessary flood warnings.

Consequences from a dam failure are expected to be moderate with the major damage center being Carthage, TN, with Smith, Trousdale, Wilson, Sumner, Davidson and Cheatham counties impacted by the inundation scenarios.  The population at risk is estimated to be less than 10,000.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.","USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.

Following this work, the dam was assessed in 2019 for any additional concerns and the risk associated with a dam breach after remediation was rated moderate. The project risk is currently driven by the consequences of an overtopping failure of the structure as a result of Tainter gate power supply issues causing increased flows and possible flooding downstream.  Consequences from a dam failure are expected to be high with major damage centers at Gordonsville, Carthage, Hendersonville, and Nashville.  The population at risk is estimated to be over 65,000.  Additional evaluation of the Tainter gates at Center Hill indicate there is insufficient structural capacity to operate at design loads.  Operation of the Tainter gates in certain loading conditions could cause failure of a gate or gates, leading to increased flows and inundation of structures downstream.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.","USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects the dam and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam with increased inspection and monitoring frequencies when action levels established by the PDT are exceeded.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

The major damage center impacted by a failure of Old Hickory would be Nashville, with the area between Old Hickory through Davidson County being urban with a significant population. Further downstream into Cheatham and Dickson Counties, the areas impacted are predominantly rural.  The population at risk is estimated to be 30,000.  There are currently no operating restrictions in place and no plans to change how water releases are managed.","USACE is continually taking significant steps to reduce the risk to the public.  This includes working closely with local emergency managers, regularly updating the Emergency Action Plan, and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams.  All dam safety staff are regularly trained to monitor and evaluate the condition of the dam based on key risk components.  USACE regularly inspects and monitors instruments to check the health of the dam and increase the frequency of this monitoring during lake levels rises.  This ensures that the structure is performing as designed and could help detect any areas of potential concern.  Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.","1",-86.655926197,36.296401583,"11172","11215",2.015000000000000,"17365","18060","18416017",2009/02/17,Medium,"517018",Cumberland River,2.015000000000000,"05130201001206",With Digitized,"18415569",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.019843320487595,3.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,430089831.000000000000000,430089817.000000000000000,430001278.000000000000000,430000065.000000000000000,2000.657999999999902,350002977.000000000000000,23415.096000000001368,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,430000065.000000000000000,430001282.000000000000000,430000065.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,430001274.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,6.714900000000000,29939.427899999998772,29939.427899999998772,0.000000000000000,0.052109394389700,37.372269099500002,,-9998.000000000000000,13397.000000000000000,13555.000000000000000,13397.000000000000000,0.000784110000000,"0",,2.015000104904175,20851.520000000000437,-9998.000000000000000,19505.018000000000029,-9998.000000000000000,20049.933000000000902,-9998.000000000000000,36036.379999999997381,-9998.000000000000000,32493.943999999999505,-9998.000000000000000,31929.798999999999069,-9998.000000000000000,35685.256999999997788,-9998.000000000000000,24210.515999999999622,-9998.000000000000000,29495.595000000001164,-9998.000000000000000,39096.309000000001106,-9998.000000000000000,37212.821000000003551,-9998.000000000000000,30861.278999999998632,-9998.000000000000000,29527.295999999998457,-9998.000000000000000,24151.687999999998283,-9998.000000000000000,26810.440999999998894,-9998.000000000000000,24400.666000000001077,-9998.000000000000000,17556.704000000001543,-9998.000000000000000,20173.930000000000291,-9998.000000000000000,13478.043999999999869,-9998.000000000000000,9775.163000000000466,-9998.000000000000000,17225.114000000001397,-9998.000000000000000,8031.519000000000233,-9998.000000000000000,5267.010000000000218,-9998.000000000000000,13169.743000000000393,-9998.000000000000000,5009.261999999999716,-9998.000000000000000,4327.845000000000255,-9998.000000000000000,12469.670000000000073,-9998.000000000000000,3798.018999999999778,-9998.000000000000000,2769.918999999999869,-9998.000000000000000,10420.543999999999869,-9998.000000000000000,4698.349000000000160,-9998.000000000000000,2842.163000000000011,-9998.000000000000000,10328.889999999999418,-9998.000000000000000,19028.639999999999418,-9998.000000000000000,12520.172000000000480,-9998.000000000000000,13654.209000000000742,-9998.000000000000000,31566.153999999998632,-9998.000000000000000,29049.004000000000815,-9998.000000000000000,24472.222000000001572,-9998.000000000000000,0.015303861388500,1215609.419440000085160,0.024781250345900,05a,"05","1","18415989",Lake,,"1",90.3851782195552,-9646493.57880349,4341482.79257084,-9646523.64076882,4341397.55315107

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 619.3 up to river flows of 63,000 cfs.  The 63,000 cfs flow is exceeded about 20% of the time and occurs most years (primarily in the spring).  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 9 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2019, USACE considers Lock & Dam 9 to be a low-risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents.  Other risks include the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping or scour at the overflow spillways.","USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public.

The gated spillway is regulated to hold a constant pool level for navigation purposes at elevation 630.3 up to river flows of 95,000 cfs.  The 95,000 cfs flow has an annual chance of exceedance of about 50% each year.  Above this flow, the gates are fully opened, and the dam has less than one foot of impact on the river stages. The maximum water level differential across the dam is 11 feet and occurs at low river flows.  Based upon a risk assessment in 2019, USACE considers Lock & Dam 8 to be a low-risk dam among its more than 700 dams. Identified risks are primarily due to aging miter gates in the locks, and potential for navigation accidents.  Other risks include the failure of the earth dam due to overtopping or scour at the overflow spillways.","USACE is continuously taking steps to reduce the risk to the public. USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam and prioritizing activities that will most impact these risks.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

The classification was based on the possibility of large flood events putting water on components of the Tainter gate system that could lead to the failure of the gates. The design of the Tainter gate system on the dam would lead to all 10 gates failing under this scenario. The risk was reanalyzed in April 2021 to determine what would happen if all Tainter gates dropped to the closed position during a large flood. Due to the topography of the land in the vicinity of the lock and dam and the inflows during such an event, flooding impacts were almost identical whether the gates were open or closed. Based on these results, Starved Rock Lock and Dam was resubmitted for consideration to reclassify the risk of the project. The risk was reclassified as low in July 2021. Although unlikely, a dam failure would impact river navigation upstream of the dam only.  There is no estimated life loss resulting from a failure of the dam and the flood wave produced by a dam failure would remain within the riverbanks resulting in minimal to no downstream property damages.","USACE works to reduce the risks posed to the community by Starved Rock Lock and Dam. USACE operations and engineering staff routinely conduct detailed inspections of the project to ensure the integrity of the lock and dam, identify new deficiencies, and monitor known deficiencies. The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and regular maintenance activities. The dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program that allows USACE staff to regularly monitor the dam’s performance under changing river conditions. The dam’s Emergency Action Plan is updated regularly, and the emergency notification charts are updated annually. This plan has been coordinated with state and local Emergency Management Agencies to help improve their dam incident response planning and preparedness responsibilities. Emergency exercises are routinely held with local and state emergency responders and stakeholders to enhance the local communities’ emergency response plans. USACE is developing a detailed communication plan based on the latest risk assessment findings and will engage in communication activities with state and local representatives, stakeholders, emergency managers, and the general public to increase awareness.","1",-88.9852645399999,41.322805239,"15110","15123",2.514000000000000,"21589","22867","14835401",2009/04/28,Medium,"410769",Illinois River,0.009000000000000,"07130001001917",With Digitized,"120049711",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.000104932253105,2.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,510107914.000000000000000,510108480.000000000000000,510005862.000000000000000,510000257.000000059604645,2289.009000000000015,350002977.000000000000000,15526.513000000000829,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,2.000000000000000,510000257.000000059604645,510005877.000000000000000,510000257.000000059604645,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,510005846.000000000000000,99.849289999999996,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.001800000000000,28545.782400000000052,28545.782400000000052,0.000000000000000,0.000219984134271,19.849594344900002,,-9998.000000000000000,13703.000000000000000,13749.000000000000000,13749.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.008999999612570,8876.021000000000640,1.514740000000000,7595.533000000000357,1.499610000000000,13120.162000000000262,1.553540000000000,15079.380999999999403,1.906810000000000,14719.343999999999141,2.001030000000000,11789.021000000000640,1.484780000000000,13731.041999999999462,1.829250000000000,12014.245999999999185,1.828010000000000,14011.459000000000742,1.597760000000000,22447.775000000001455,2.282820000000000,4109.055000000000291,1.168020000000000,19533.615000000001601,1.846540000000000,26364.241000000001804,2.458830000000000,13550.058999999999287,1.928250000000000,19566.510999999998603,1.847920000000000,16293.203999999999724,1.973890000000000,13261.123999999999796,1.909810000000000,16697.375000000000000,1.723600000000000,9278.244000000000597,1.543470000000000,10469.620999999999185,1.720930000000000,15641.094999999999345,1.675330000000000,5505.536000000000058,1.244520000000000,10153.179000000000087,1.698090000000000,11660.521000000000640,1.477950000000000,3733.452000000000226,1.070050000000000,5617.849000000000160,1.323330000000000,9475.816999999999098,1.355950000000000,2538.619000000000142,0.928990000000000,3726.501999999999953,1.124560000000000,9174.649999999999636,1.338140000000000,1852.602000000000089,0.833390000000000,2473.269999999999982,0.964900000000000,8015.905999999999949,1.266890000000000,7265.978000000000065,1.393110000000000,2514.896999999999935,0.970740000000000,9856.540999999999258,1.378090000000000,12597.227999999999156,1.761220000000000,10836.811999999999898,1.747020000000000,12331.704999999999927,1.513230000000000,,,,07a,"07","1","14837681",River,,"1",87.2272862537459,-9905794.33669754,5060072.59440153,-9905821.36985731,5059989.66185219

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

A major storm with significant rainfall west of Hot Springs, upstream of Lake Ouachita, would lead to significant increases in the reservoir level which could potentially cause the dam to overtop and fail.

If the reservoir level rises above the overflow spillway, water would spill across the concrete saddle at the top, potentially causing it to break apart as the water erodes the earthen and rock spillway below. Because the spillway has not been used in the past, there is uncertainty about how it would perform in such a situation. Another issue is the possibility of cracking where the earthen dam contacts the rock foundation below, leading to water seeping through and causing erosion along the crack. Water flowing through even a small fracture could continue to grow, allowing more water to flow through, eventually leading to a failure.

As a result of either of these scenarios, near downstream areas along the Ouachita River including Mountain Pine could have less than one hour to evacuate while areas farther downstream, from Hot Springs to Malvern, would also need to evacuate quickly. In a worst-case scenario, a large portion of land in Garland and Hot Spring Counties will experience some flooding, and local highways would be flooded. Flooding downstream would be swift and deep, destroying buildings and infrastructure, potentially killing anyone remaining in the area. It could cause water depths across highways 27, 70 and 270 so deep that those roadways would need to be closed. In addition, the downstream reservoirs of Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine would also quickly fill with water and overflow.

Additionally, reservoir levels that rise above the overflow spillway at Blakely Mountain Dam will lead to increased downstream water levels in Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine, even if failure of the dam or spillway does not occur. Because Lake Ouachita has never experienced reservoir levels to this degree, downstream communities may not be aware of the potential for high water downstream of Blakely Mountain Dam during spillway flow.","To ensure Blakely Mountain Dam continues to operate to minimize flood risk and provide hydroelectric and water supply benefits, USACE has developed a surveillance and monitoring plan for the project, and performs increased surveillance during flooding with continuous monitoring of the dam at greater frequencies during periods of high water. USACE regularly inspects the dam and its components quarterly, annually, and periodically at various levels of detail. USACE also keeps emergency supplies and equipment on-site to be able to quickly respond to and flood fight any incidents that could occur at the dam.

USACE performs periodic risk assessments on a 10-year frequency with the most recent assessment performed in 2020 to identify issues, determine project risk, and quantify downstream impacts. Interim Risk-Reduction Measures (IRRMs) are in place to reduce the risk of the project in the near term which includes a berm and a seepage collection system which have been installed at the dam to monitor for seepage.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

While unlikely, a non-breach release when the reservoir is full is critical to reduce the chance of dam overtopping, even if streams and rivers below the dam have reached or exceeded their capacity. Impacts on downstream populations and structures along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would be overwhelming, but a breach would allow water stored behind the dam to significantly intensify downstream flooding.
 
When USACE last assessed the dam’s ability to meet flood risk management goals, it was determined that the primary threats that could lead to a breach during an extreme flood, with the reservoir at or near its maximum storage level, are erosion of the dam’s foundation from water flowing beneath the embankment, damage to the spillway during non-breach releases, and powerhouse flooding leading to an inability to provide power to open the spillway gates. Although these scenarios are very unlikely, failure of the dam or spillway would result in catastrophic flooding with swift, deep, and life-threatening floodwater in numerous communities (both with and without levees) along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This would substantially impact property, the economy, and critical infrastructure (such as power and water utilities, transportation systems, and commercial and industrial facilities).  

USACE categorized the risk associated with Gavins Point Dam as “moderate” among its more than 700 dams due to the potential loss of life and large, national-scale consequences should abreach occur. This database and the accompanying inundation maps provide additional details, including consequences for a range of release volumes, non-breach releases, and dam failure.  Please note that some scenarios in this database for the six USACE dams on the upper Missouri River do not depict the full extent of downstream inundation including the extent of “cascading” inundation that could develop from upstream Missouri River dam failure(s). For more information on the USACE Dam Safety Program and risk assessments, visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.","Ongoing Actions: The USACE Dam Safety Program takes proactive steps to reduce risk to life, property, and the environment during both normal operations and extreme floods. Dam experts routinely monitor and observe the dam, conduct regular maintenance and repairs, and work closely with state and local emergency management agencies with responsibilities in communities potentially affected by high flows to improve preparedness, evacuation planning, and public awareness of flood risks. For more information visit: https://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Dam-Safety-Program.

Actions at Gavins Point Dam: While USACE continues to evaluate how to further reduce the risks associated with Gavins Point Dam, several risk reduction measures were completed, including the installation of additional drains to further control water flowing through the dam’s foundation, additional instrumentation to enhance foundation monitoring, and construction of a large downstream filter to prevent erosion of the foundation soil. Numerous repairs have also been made to the spillway to improve its resiliency during future flood events and a portable generator is now available to provide back-up power to operate the spillway gates if the powerhouse floods. 

Building Awareness:  Since dams do not eliminate flood risk, communities downstream of USACE’s Missouri River dams are encouraged to monitor National Weather Service flood forecasts during periods of heavy rain and snowmelt and learn about potential flood impacts to their family, home, and community. It is important to understand community notification plans, including safe, efficient evacuation routes, and consider preparedness and emergency actions to reduce individual risks.

The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Beaver Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam’s construction. Beaver Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.","USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Beaver Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities.

The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although Beaver Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam’s construction. Beaver Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.","USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Beaver Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.

The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Norfork Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and earthquake events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when the dam operates as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam’s construction. Norfork Dam has an Emergency Action Plan and Risk Reduction Plan in place to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.","USACE performs ongoing activities to ensure the integrity of Norfork Dam and to manage and reduce risk to the downstream communities. The dam is well maintained, inspected, and monitored. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.

The dam significantly reduces the risk of flooding to surrounding communities. However, it does not entirely eliminate the risk. Although the Greers Ferry Dam has historically performed well, extreme rainfall and earthquake events may cause areas downstream to be flooded. Even when USACE operates the dam as intended, downstream flooding could still occur if a very large rainfall event were to require unusually large quantities of water to be released through the dam gates. In extreme cases, this flooding could be similar to what was experienced prior to the dam’s construction. A less likely scenario would be if one of the gates were to have a problem during operation. In this case, more water than intended could be released, but that additional discharge would be limited to the amount that could pass through one gate. The most devastating potential scenario, but significantly less likely to happen, would occur if the dam were subjected to a large earthquake while the lake level was already high. In this unlikely event, an uncontrolled release of water could flow out of the reservoir, resulting in potentially deadly flooding of Heber Springs and Searcy, Arkansas, and other downstream communities. Greers Ferry Dam has an Emergency Action Plan to lower the risk of life loss if any of these scenarios occurred.","USACE performs ongoing inspection, maintenance, and monitoring activities to ensure the integrity of Greers Ferry Dam and to reduce risk to downstream communities. The frequency of inspection and monitoring increases during high water events. USACE regularly updates the Emergency Action Plan for the dam and performs emergency response exercises with federal, state, and local emergency managers to remain prepared to respond to flood events affecting the dam.

This classification is based primarily on the large populations living downstream of the dam that could be flooded in the event of a failure of the dam.  Although unlikely, the primary risk to the integrity of the dam is a flood so large that the capacity of the dam to store water is exceeded and water flows over the top of the dam even with maximum possible releases being made through the gates. Failure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream and widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life.  In the remote event of a dam failure the largest impacts would be to the cities of Sand Springs (including those areas behind the Tulsa West Tulsa Levee System), Tulsa, Jenks (including those areas behind the Jenks Levee System), Bixby, Muskogee, and other communities along the Arkansas River. Bridges crossing the Arkansas River and key infrastructure along the river from Sand Springs to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed. 
A more likely flooding scenario includes a large release through the gated spillway during a flood with the project operating as intended.   Although the inundation would not be as great as a breach of the dam, this scenario could still result in widespread economic impacts and loss of life due to the extent of the flooding possible as part of normal operation of the dam.","USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Keystone Dam poses to the community.  A dam safety modification study is underway to evaluate alternatives to potentially modify the dam to directly reduce risk.  
There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  Additionally, the dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring system to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.","1",-96.252972466,36.1498908890001,"24060","25097",3.460000000000000,"13347","14149","369153",2005/08/30,Medium,"78956",Arkansas River,0.314000000000000,"11110101000064",With Digitized,"120049909",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.003445359233034,2.000000000000000,8.000000000000000,8.000000000000000,390001615.000000000000000,390001614.000000000000000,390000889.999999940395355,350009839.000000000000000,1756.384000000000015,350002977.000000000000000,133644.546999999991385,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,2.000000000000000,350009839.000000000000000,390000892.000000000000000,350009839.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,390000888.000000000000000,37.107149999999997,46.263849999999998,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.108000000000000,217425.841199999995297,182792.866500000003725,0.000000000000000,0.006223893277570,13.626094334199999,,-9998.000000000000000,19763.000000000000000,19763.000000000000000,19763.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.314000010490417,8809.478999999999360,1.897530000000000,10275.629000000000815,1.917470000000000,10140.799999999999272,1.915750000000000,4013.751999999999953,1.355230000000000,3272.324999999999818,1.184780000000000,5589.149999999999636,1.479860000000000,2305.512000000000171,1.088260000000000,2242.681000000000040,1.025470000000000,6830.637999999999920,1.611520000000000,9147.761000000000422,1.929650000000000,14482.868000000000393,2.239120000000000,16223.102999999999156,2.371250000000000,12052.224000000000160,2.185290000000000,14513.431000000000495,2.241280000000000,15339.226000000000568,2.310790000000000,18634.516999999999825,2.673940000000000,23862.900000000001455,2.825360000000000,17220.770000000000437,2.437670000000000,15403.596999999999753,2.446460000000000,19309.274000000001251,2.557700000000000,16550.973999999998341,2.393280000000000,13696.945999999999913,2.317210000000000,13031.460999999999331,2.133840000000000,9344.811999999999898,1.847470000000000,12223.816999999999098,2.199430000000000,12284.075000000000728,2.077470000000000,6429.077000000000226,1.570270000000000,8558.192999999999302,1.873300000000000,11239.740999999999985,1.995950000000000,5934.085000000000036,1.517710000000000,6678.377999999999702,1.680200000000000,11948.923000000000684,2.051680000000000,7435.189000000000306,1.671550000000000,4645.448999999999614,1.439710000000000,8890.025999999999840,1.798350000000000,9030.475000000000364,1.819760000000000,1516.750000000000000,0.932780000000000,1438.851000000000113,0.874910000000000,5937.096999999999753,1.518030000000000,,,,11c,"11","1","369151",Mixed,,"1",49.21540242838,-10714831.8826994,4321265.77654614,-10714855.9277594,4321222.83483069

While the dam was noted to be in good condition during the assessment, two primary risk drivers identified were: (1) The potential for water seeping at the contact of the rock and earthen dam to erode the embankment and eventually weakens the dam and leading to breach, and (2) The potential for water seeping through the embankment along the discharge conduit to erode the embankment eventually leading to breach.  Failure of the dam would include catastrophic flooding downstream and widespread economic impacts and significant loss of life. In the remote event of a dam failure, the largest impacts would be to the cities of Claremore, Collinsville, Owasso, Verdigris, Tulsa, Jenks (including those areas behind the Jenks Levee System), and other communities along the Arkansas River. Bridges crossing the Verdigris River and key infrastructure along the river from Oologah to Webbers Falls could also be damaged or destroyed, including operation and access of the Kerr-McClellan Navigational System.

There are also operational risks associated with planned gate releases during a flood event at Oologah Dam. While flooding would be less than a breach scenario, life loss and significant economic impacts could still occur due to the possible extent of flooding.","There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Oologah Dam poses to downstream communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, yearly updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam.  The dam is well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities, and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.

Although extremely unlikely, the primary risk to the integrity of the lock and dam is the potential for erosion of the rock foundation at the spillway to lead to failure.  Failure of the dam would include a disruption to navigation and economic impacts.  Widespread flooding could occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood). A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes.  For a large flood along the river the biggest impacts would be to the cities of Fort Gibson, Muskogee, and other communities along the Arkansas River.","There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage the risk that Chouteau Lock and Dam poses to downstream communities and those that rely on river navigation.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.","1",-95.755669014,38.242243321,"24283","24272",2.288000000000000,"15254","16444","20888779",2005/08/30,Medium,"1095788",Neosho River,0.758000000000000,"11070204001917",With Digitized,"0",StreamRiver,"46006",0.008302080889600,3.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,390097470.000000000000000,390097478.000000000000000,390010340.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,2144.440000000000055,350002977.000000000000000,8711.351000000000568,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,390010376.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,390010301.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.301500000000000,7861.379399999999805,7861.379399999999805,0.000000000000000,0.024674710020500,21.182669067199999,,-9998.000000000000000,30649.000000000000000,30851.000000000000000,30851.000000000000000,0.000010000000000,"0",,0.758000016212463,977.682000000000016,1.141240000000000,1121.215999999999894,1.150530000000000,1414.087999999999965,1.166510000000000,184.282999999999987,0.651740000000000,170.573000000000008,0.618230000000000,417.336999999999989,0.757260000000000,402.327999999999975,0.828150000000000,514.025999999999954,0.864980000000000,887.129999999999995,0.978310000000000,1575.397999999999911,1.381360000000000,2327.425000000000182,1.549500000000000,2525.902999999999793,1.476090000000000,1878.564000000000078,1.486470000000000,2399.175000000000182,1.569680000000000,2464.628000000000156,1.460960000000000,2649.001999999999953,1.722320000000000,3343.943999999999960,1.812850000000000,3196.547999999999774,1.631610000000000,1631.306000000000040,1.401410000000000,2112.760999999999967,1.487340000000000,2433.364000000000033,1.453170000000000,1045.430000000000064,1.171410000000000,946.220000000000027,1.077970000000000,1416.490000000000009,1.167290000000000,760.421000000000049,1.037200000000000,670.486999999999966,0.949320000000000,792.597999999999956,0.939410000000000,579.004000000000019,0.938990000000000,700.409999999999968,0.964360000000000,739.802999999999997,0.916730000000000,436.324000000000012,0.851030000000000,770.871999999999957,0.998610000000000,1022.905999999999949,1.030940000000000,327.774999999999977,0.774560000000000,558.503000000000043,0.890050000000000,1032.978000000000065,1.034710000000000,227.969999999999999,0.692810000000000,305.199999999999989,0.730390000000000,622.437999999999988,0.863410000000000,,,,11c,"11","1","20888801",River,,"1",53.8642394895945,-10659472.3147624,4613703.41636646,-10659521.8922349,4613682.35857632

Although extremely unlikely, the primary risks to the integrity of the dam are the potential for: (1) sliding or overturning of the concrete dam sections during high lake levels, and (2) water seeping at the base of the earthen dam eventually weakens the dam and leads to embankment slope failure. In the remote event of a dam failure, the most immediate impacted areas with the major population center would be the towns of Fort Gibson, Muskogee, and Okay. Other impacted areas include the towns of River Bottom, Webbers Falls, Moffett, Arkoma, Pocola, and Ft. Smith.  Failure of the dam would result in widespread flooding in these areas resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure along the river and within the inundation path. 
A more likely flooding scenario is the potential for large releases out of the spillway gates due to a large flood as part of normal operation.  Although the flooding for this scenario would be less than expected for a dam breach life loss and economic impacts could still occur due to the extent of flooding.","USACE is taking several actions to manage and reduce the risk that Fort Gibson Dam poses to the surrounding communities. This includes conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the project. Additionally, the dam and dikes are well maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the project during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structures. Lastly, the dam has an instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.","1",-95.230827145,35.86965013,"24361","24360",7.030000000000000,"15254","15270","21773861",2005/08/30,Medium,"1095788",Neosho River,0.173000000000000,"11070209000004",With Digitized,"120049909",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.001548741475193,3.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,7.000000000000000,390126394.000000000000000,390126395.000000000000000,390005059.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,1633.951999999999998,350002977.000000000000000,25642.228999999999360,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,390005068.000000000000000,390004971.000000059604645,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,390005049.000000000000000,94.590869999999995,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.146700000000000,32488.522199999999430,32488.522199999999430,0.000000000000000,0.001549865231750,11.936808492400001,,-9998.000000000000000,15175.000000000000000,15410.000000000000000,15175.000000000000000,0.013583810000000,"0",,0.172999992966652,9866.945999999999913,4.214130000000000,11519.161000000000058,4.263420000000000,10658.163000000000466,4.238610000000001,6972.612000000000080,3.556540000000000,5556.761999999999716,2.993960000000000,8249.934999999999491,3.738850000000000,11211.460999999999331,4.488260000000001,8519.043999999999869,3.677950000000000,8890.441999999999098,3.877800000000000,16935.145000000000437,5.511690000000000,27469.558000000000902,6.582690000000000,16411.393000000000029,5.251040000000000,16782.437999999998283,5.486730000000000,19999.076000000000931,5.609550000000000,16408.422999999998865,5.250560000000000,16089.424000000000888,5.372060000000000,20581.486000000000786,5.690980000000000,14510.985000000000582,4.938360000000000,9425.042999999999665,4.120250000000001,11899.469999999999345,4.332230000000000,14613.322000000000116,4.955670000000000,5369.137999999999920,3.135690000000000,5016.319000000000415,2.851940000000000,9638.772999999999229,4.034310000000000,3642.907999999999902,2.609420000000000,3458.001999999999953,2.396010000000000,4854.462000000000444,2.896950000000000,3320.128000000000156,2.498800000000000,4236.203999999999724,2.633590000000000,4932.756000000000313,2.919040000000000,2414.547999999999774,2.157990000000000,4299.800000000000182,2.652060000000000,7042.542000000000371,3.462390000000000,9593.619000000000597,4.156300000000000,18951.812000000001717,5.460290000000000,11538.308999999999287,4.407740000000001,12592.924000000000888,4.754290000000000,8130.930000000000291,3.595540000000000,10257.837999999999738,4.159520000000000,,,,11c,"11","1","21773863",Mixed,,"1",78.0754938788391,-10601047.1861603,4282700.22243968,-10600969.1153502,4282701.07763453

During infrequent emergency operations, larger required releases passing through the project’s gated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled spillway flow has never occurred, uncontrolled flow through the spillways would greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Canadian River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including State Highways 433 and 104) along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.  

A screening level risk assessment of the Conchas Dam project was completed in 2009.  Preliminary results characterized dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation could be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including State Highways 433 and 104) along the Canadian River to Ute Dam.","USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquake or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities include maintenance of mechanical equipment and sediment removal.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.","1",-104.190495977,35.4026994490001,"24446","24509",2.226000000000000,"13987","16506","20031197",2005/08/30,Medium,"1101881",Canadian River,0.037000000000000,"11080006000134",With Digitized,"0",Connector,"33400",0.000349315278790,3.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,6.000000000000000,390092920.000000000000000,390092771.000000000000000,390010651.000000000000000,390000311.000000000000000,2845.485000000000127,350002977.000000000000000,10421.019000000000233,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,390000311.000000000000000,390010690.000000000000000,390000311.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,390010611.000000000000000,99.376390000000001,99.659570000000002,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,18916.011900000001333,18916.011900000001333,0.000000000000000,0.001230773395790,33.510425608500000,,-9998.000000000000000,-9998.000000000000000,128111.000000000000000,128111.000000000000000,-9998.000000000000000,"0",,0.037000000476837,965.110000000000014,1.502360000000000,1106.688000000000102,1.538000000000000,191.836999999999989,1.141550000000000,636.317000000000007,1.215350000000000,559.664999999999964,1.087990000000000,58.899000000000001,0.637650000000000,209.644000000000005,0.700390000000000,296.550000000000011,0.793460000000000,59.884000000000000,0.642750000000000,826.184999999999945,1.387720000000000,1189.965999999999894,1.596270000000000,111.081000000000003,0.868830000000000,1368.125999999999976,1.797260000000000,1764.890000000000100,1.955610000000000,190.587999999999994,1.137790000000000,1705.133000000000038,2.013760000000000,2145.500000000000000,2.163760000000000,455.673999999999978,1.774830000000000,1324.156999999999925,1.767260000000000,1720.167999999999893,1.929840000000000,334.357000000000028,1.513950000000000,1416.640000000000100,1.829840000000000,1289.781999999999925,1.663680000000000,257.009000000000015,1.323780000000000,1618.644000000000005,1.960250000000000,1478.898999999999887,1.785040000000000,355.384000000000015,1.561990000000000,1038.888999999999896,1.560110000000000,1279.351000000000113,1.656750000000000,224.207999999999998,1.235150000000000,785.616999999999962,1.352590000000000,1391.765000000000100,1.730080000000000,144.026000000000010,0.988570000000000,754.239000000000033,1.324820000000000,1332.933999999999969,1.692060000000000,108.176000000000002,0.857520000000000,333.550999999999988,0.879420000000000,416.701999999999998,0.938730000000000,53.020000000000003,0.606350000000000,,,,11b,"11","1","20030635",Mixed,,"1",1.52676921467094,-11598432.9579922,4218741.94891205,-11598434.3507012,4218742.57452042

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

Kerr Lock and Dam as low. Although unlikely, the primary risks identified during the 2012 assessment are: (1) the potential for overtopping and concentrated flow over the embankment resulting in erosion and (2) the potential for water seeping through the embankment during a high pool resulting in failure.  A more likely potential for failure and loss of navigation was identified in recent inspections. These inspections identified deteriorating conditions of the spillway gates. Failure of these gates would not likely result in significant downstream flooding but would result in loss of navigation capability.  

Widespread flooding could occur downstream as part of normal operation of the dam (when the gates are fully opened during a large flood). A large increase in downstream flooding would not be expected if the dam were to fail as the dam is not designed or operated to reduce downstream flooding, but instead for navigation purposes.  However, life loss could still be possible due to the extent of flooding. The largest impacts from flooding would be to the cities of Fort Smith, AR; Van Buren, AR; Mulberry, AR; Ozark, AR and other communities along the Arkansas River. Bridges crossing the Arkansas River and key infrastructure along the river could also be damaged or destroyed.","There are numerous activities that USACE conducts on a day to day basis to help manage risk.  USACE is performing rehabilitation and painting of the deteriorated gates, with additional work needed and planned in coming years.  Additional measures include conducting emergency exercises with local and state emergency responders to enhance evacuation planning, routine updates to the Emergency Action Plan to improve emergency response actions, and development of a detailed communication plan for the dam. Additionally, the dam is maintained through continuous operations and maintenance activities and USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure.  Lastly, the dam has a robust instrumentation and monitoring program to allow USACE staff to evaluate the dam for changing conditions.","1",-94.777402594,35.3467939650001,"25216","25215",1.607000000000000,"13347","13974","1543609",2009/11/30,Medium,"78956",Arkansas River,0.163000000000000,"11110104000210",With Digitized,"120049917",ArtificialPath,"55800",0.001635873372023,2.000000000000000,9.000000000000000,9.000000000000000,390030777.000000000000000,390030774.000000000000000,390000277.000000000000000,350009839.000000000000000,1529.862000000000080,350002977.000000000000000,236082.405999999988126,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,2.000000000000000,350009839.000000000000000,390000278.000000000000000,350009839.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,390000276.000000000000000,93.265730000000005,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.192600000000000,369144.214199999987613,369144.214199999987613,0.000000000000000,0.001134813975960,11.386048094400000,,-9998.000000000000000,12543.000000000000000,12632.000000000000000,12568.000000000000000,0.003926380000000,"0",,0.163000002503395,37043.690999999998894,5.431520000000000,43690.305999999996857,5.500460000000000,39123.480999999992491,5.454240000000000,20397.215000000000146,4.040290000000000,15552.291999999999462,3.308510000000000,28699.698000000000320,4.673600000000000,33034.504999999997381,5.129200000000000,21203.412000000000262,3.845250000000000,25461.190999999998894,4.404710000000000,57820.957999999998719,6.797950000000000,98430.345000000001164,8.300240000000002,65918.884000000005472,7.096780000000000,59374.201000000000931,6.889940000000000,67982.301999999996042,6.874350000000000,55989.720000000001164,6.533080000000000,69265.586999999999534,7.451090000000000,89560.067999999999302,7.909350000000000,60662.142999999996391,6.803730000000000,46261.129000000000815,6.073100000000000,57071.472999999998137,6.291880000000000,54705.779000000002270,6.456870000000000,32560.421999999998661,5.092340000000000,31503.126000000000204,4.672760000000000,33184.410000000003492,5.023460000000000,26830.948000000000320,4.625110000000000,27980.143000000000029,4.406400000000000,19101.625000000000000,3.824970000000000,21437.288000000000466,4.140160000000000,28954.526999999998225,4.481570000000000,17386.845000000001164,3.653650000000000,16485.717000000000553,3.641370000000000,29619.810000000001310,4.532220000000000,26197.762999999999010,4.467220000000000,24266.728999999999360,4.400890000000001,49926.317000000002736,5.881650000000000,40541.580999999998312,5.552450000000000,29722.099999999998545,4.866170000000000,16417.246999999999389,3.395990000000000,29287.225999999998749,4.720830000000000,,,,11c,"11","1","1543603",Mixed,,"1",29.9954878383483,-10550572.1950279,4211109.49915115,-10550550.0930307,4211089.22031956

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans.

The most likely scenario that could result in downstream flooding due to floodwaters passed through Lewisville Dam are high volume releases from the dam during high water events. These surcharge operational releases occur when the reservoir's flood storage capacity is exceeded causing flooding in areas adjacent to the reservoir and excess water flows through the spillway and/or outlet works. Lewisville Dam is designed to reduce the peak flooding levels downstream without risking the structural integrity of the dam. Generally, the Elm Fork Trinity River's large floods are long-duration type lasting weeks or even months; however, it is possible that large peak and volume floods could occur in about two weeks duration. Despite the flood reduction benefits the dam provides, very rare, severe storms could still produce high surcharge releases with the potential to exceed the capacity of the downstream levees and impact the communities of Lewisville, Coppell, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving, and Dallas.

In October 2014, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential hazards to the dam, expected performance, and associated consequences. The risk assessment classified the risks associated with the Lewisville Dam as high. The classification is based on an extremely unlikely flood event, unlike anything ever experienced by the project, that could lead to a dam breach or large flows over the spillway and potentially to instability of the structure, eventually breaching the dam. In either scenario, downstream flood waters would be deep and move swiftly through the cities located along the Trinity River in Denton and Dallas Counties, including downtown Dallas. This flooding due to dam breach could overflow levees and cause catastrophic damage to buildings and critical infrastructure. Flooded river depths immediately downstream of the dam could exceed the height of a four-story building. Additionally, there would be flood impacts experienced along the Trinity River all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Although large downstream communities have thorough, well- practiced emergency action plans; local emergency managers who are aware of the unlikely potential for dam failure; local emergency managers who meet regularly with USACE to discuss emergency response to flood events; and a community that is aware of the remote potential for flooding, if a breach of the dam were to occur thousands of people’s lives would be at risk within the inundated area. The USACE is currently constructing dam modifications to reduce the likelihood of breach associated with the risk driving factors identified during the risk assessment.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District continuously takes additional steps to reduce the risk to the public. This includes working closely with local emergency managers to encourage and support the development and update of local evacuation plans to maximize evacuation time and designated evacuation routes; regularly updating the Lewisville Dam Emergency Action Plan; and conducting emergency exercises with state and local response teams. In addition, USACE continues to identify and implement interim risk reduction measures such as clearing vegetation from the sides of the dam, conducting regular surveillance of the dam, and automating instrumentation to track the performance of the dam. USACE conducts detailed inspections of the dam during both normal lake levels and increased surveillance during flood events to ensure the integrity of the structure. Instrumentation and monitoring systems allow USACE staff to monitor the dam for changing conditions that may not be seen at the surface. The frequency of these dam inspections increases when the lake level rises. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

Risk Management of Lewisville Dam is also a priority for USACE at the national level which has led to the design and current construction of dam safety modifications to address deficiencies identified for Lewisville Dam. While the probability of failure is remote, the risk to human life and property should failure occur is high enough to warrant remediation of the identified deficiencies. The actions being taken to address the deficiencies include constructing a downstream inverted filter berm and seepage collection trenches at two locations, anchoring the spillway weir and constructing an upstream cutoff, overlay the apron on the downstream side of the spillway, and construct a barrier wall downstream of the spillway. In addition, further measures are being taken to reduce risk by adding a filter around the outlet conduit to reduce the possibility of erosion, constructing an upstream berm to address slope stability issues, and partnering with the City of Lewisville to relocate waterlines that previously encroached on the embankment to reduce risk of embankment erosion from a waterline rupture.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project’s gated outlet works would surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Additionally, at high lake levels portions of State Highway 84, upstream of the project near Ghost Ranch, and State Highway 96 may be flooded.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillway have never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Impacted communities include Abiquiu, Mendenales, Chamita, Hernandez, Ohkay Owingeh, Española, Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and communities located in between.

USACE completed a risk assessment of the Abiquiu Dam project in 2019.  Results generally characterize dam breach risk as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by seepage induced loss of earthen embankment material into the joints of the adjacent canyon abutment rock during high pools was identified.  For high lake levels that can occur during normal operation or during an extreme event, the annual probability of dam breach due to seepage loss of embankment dam materials is estimated to be low (1 in 1,000,000).  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Chama and Rio Grande to Cochiti Lake.  Impacted communities include Abiquiu, Mendenales, Chamita, Hernandez, Ohkay Owingeh, Española, Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and communities located in between.","USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  An Issue Evaluation Study was completed in 2019 to assess dam breach risk and included investigation of project features and installation of additional instruments to improve performance monitoring.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included replacement of damaged sections of air vent pipes, repair of deteriorated rock protection, and installation of new seepage monitoring instruments.  A project to repair bulkhead gates and effort streamline instrument data collection is planned.

During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project’s gated outlet works could surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillway have never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Rio Grande, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include Algodones, Bernalillo, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and communities located in between.

A screening level risk assessment of the Cochiti Dam project was completed in 2009.  Screening level results characterize risk for dam breach as LOW due to the combination of life loss consequences and low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the result of an extreme event.  Specifically, the occurrence of dam breach caused by overtopping the dam as the consequence of an extreme storm event was identified but the probability of dam breach due to overtopping caused by an extreme event is estimated to be low.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Rio Grande to Elephant Butte Lake.  Impacted communities include Santo Domingo Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo, Algodones, Bernalillo, Pueblo of Sandia Village, low lying areas in Corrales and Albuquerque, Isleta Pueblo, Los Lunas, Socorro, and small communities located in between.","USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquake or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included gate rehabilitation, repair and replacement of aging electrical and mechanical components, and routine vegetation removal.

During infrequent emergency operation, larger required releases through the project’s gated outlet works would surpass downstream river channel capacity and flood low-lying areas along the Pecos River.  Although the progression of events leading to much larger, uncontrolled flow through the spillway have never occurred, uncontrolled spillway flow could greatly surpass downstream channel capacity, flood low-lying areas along the Pecos River, and be life-threatening.  Flood inundation caused by uncontrolled spillway flow could cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Pecos River to Fort Sumner Lake, impacting the city of Santa Rosa and surrounding communities.

USACE completed a risk assessment of the Santa Rosa Dam project in 2015.  Results characterize dam breach risk as NORMAL due to the combination of tolerable level of life-risk and very low likelihood of dam breach occurring either during normal operations or as the consequence of an extreme event.  However, if a dam breach were to occur, flood inundation would be life-threatening and cause catastrophic downstream damages to residences and infrastructure (including levees) along the Pecos River to Fort Sumner Lake, impacting the city of Santa Rosa and surrounding communities.","USACE strives to manage risk through application of several measures including inspections and instrument evaluations, assessments and studies, maintenance activities, and risk communication.  Routine inspections and instrument evaluation are performed to monitor performance of the project.  Special inspections or increased inspection frequency occurs during high pools, spillway flows, or in response to earthquakes or signs of distress.  Comprehensive inspections occur annually, with more detailed inspections taking place every 5 years.  Assessments occur every 10 years to compare original design and construction methods to modern standards.  Maintenance is routinely performed at the project and recent activities included gate rehabilitation, repair and replacement of aging electrical and mechanical components, and routine vegetation removal.  Future risk communication activities include revisions to the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and development of a formal risk communication plan.

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency.

The risk assessments evaluate the life safety risks associated with the dams to determine if risk reduction actions are needed and, if so, what actions should be taken. The assessment considers a wide range of hazard scenarios from the most likely to the most extreme and unlikely. USACE is conducting advanced risk assessments, called Issue Evaluation Studies (IES), at several Willamette Valley Project dams including Foster Dam. 

As of May 2021, results of the advanced study for Foster Dam identified the risk associated with the dam to be High. The risk is primarily driven by the high population downstream of the dam combined with two possible, but very unlikely events: 1) an extreme earthquake occurring at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest or 2) an extreme flood event. According to the study, the shaking from an extreme earthquake could cause the spillway gates and concrete supports on either side to become damaged. If this occurs when the reservoir is at its highest, the cracked and damaged spillway may no longer be able to hold back water, allowing a high volume of water to flow through the spillway and cause flooding of areas downstream. The study also determined that an extreme and very unlikely rainfall event could result in release of higher volumes of water through the dam than the gated spillway was designed to pass. The force and speed of the water flowing out of the dam could damage and erode the concrete lining in the spillway channel, exposing the underlying foundation rock that may be susceptible to erosion if subjected to very high flows. The continued force and speed of the water could erode the rock and destabilize the concrete structure itself. A sudden release of water could result from the destabilized concrete structure’s lost ability to hold back the forces of the reservoir, causing significant downstream flooding. Another different scenario could occur if the extreme rainfall event instead fills the reservoir at a rate faster than the spillway is able to pass flow through the dam. Fallen trees and woody debris floating in the reservoir could partially block the spillway gates during the rainfall event, further limiting the amount of water that can pass through the spillway gates and allowing the reservoir to rise above the top of the embankment dam. As water flows over the top of the dam, the speed and depth of the water could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam. As the soil and rock continue to erode, more water is released over and through the dam at greater speeds and depths, causing significant flooding downstream. Because Foster Dam is located upstream of Sweet Home and Lebanon, there is potential for flooding to affect large downstream populations in the floodplain areas.

USACE is confident that the Willamette Valley dams are well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the Willamette Valley dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.","The likelihood is low for an extreme earthquake or an extreme rainfall event to occur, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are high due to the large downstream population. USACE continues to evaluate the performance of the spillway during earthquake and flood loads using advanced computer modeling of the dam’s concrete and gated structures to better understand if and how much the spillway could become damaged. This will help inform whether the potential damages from extreme earthquake or flood loads continue to drive risk at the project, and whether short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures) or long-term modifications will be necessary to reduce risk. USACE also continues to study the likelihood of an extreme rainstorm that would be large enough to cause damaging spillway flows. USACE continues to regularly conduct routine inspections of its dams and Foster Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. Foster Dam’s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency. USACE will update the EAP based on recent risk assessment results and information from updated inundation maps. In addition, USACE will continue and increase its outreach to improve community awareness of flood risks and risks associated with the dam.","1",-122.670161151,44.4156137300001,"32868","32869",2.571000000000000,"2984","3591","23785719",2001/02/13,Medium,"1150077",South Santiam River,0.512000000000000,"17090006000052",With Digitized,"0",StreamRiver,"46006",0.006276516887145,3.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,5.000000000000000,50077823.000000000000000,50077822.000000000000000,50018692.000000000000000,50010097.000000000000000,407.826000000000022,50001315.000000000000000,948.288000000000011,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,3.000000000000000,50010097.000000000000000,50018933.000000000000000,50010097.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,1.000000000000000,50018460.000000000000000,91.335579999999993,100.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.000000000000000,0.306900000000000,1439.994599999999991,1439.994599999999991,0.000000000000000,0.008923923061300,1.641776956330000,,-9998.000000000000000,16036.000000000000000,16266.000000000000000,16036.000000000000000,0.004492180000000,"0",,0.512000024318695,2638.963999999999942,2.160160000000000,2814.253999999999905,2.169840000000000,2983.112000000000080,2.178640000000000,4518.944000000000415,2.772340000000000,4173.180999999999585,2.602990000000000,3803.422999999999774,2.436150000000000,4440.389000000000124,2.749500000000000,3539.291999999999916,2.410780000000000,2934.184000000000196,2.162290000000000,4371.934000000000196,2.729440000000000,3646.657999999999902,2.444410000000000,2948.023000000000138,2.166930000000000,3850.512000000000171,2.571560000000000,4000.273999999999887,2.552000000000000,3551.190999999999804,2.360020000000000,2932.257999999999811,2.266740000000000,3823.731999999999971,2.498870000000000,3256.789999999999964,2.267870000000000,1695.527000000000044,1.772480000000000,2068.550999999999931,1.889120000000000,1853.813000000000102,1.761150000000000,857.442999999999984,1.327780000000000,630.530999999999949,1.149560000000000,578.966000000000008,1.091500000000000,455.259000000000015,1.036750000000000,243.270999999999987,0.815670000000000,314.478999999999985,0.874720000000000,290.951999999999998,0.882630000000000,199.522999999999996,0.764990000000000,449.230000000000018,0.992790000000000,664.418999999999983,1.198670000000000,479.019999999999982,1.035350000000000,896.336000000000013,1.296060000000000,3351.264999999999873,2.410680000000000,3324.813000000000102,2.342140000000000,3956.190999999999804,2.481110000000000,4256.576000000000022,2.695310000000000,4634.658999999999651,2.734410000000000,5208.682999999999993,2.822780000000000,,,,17c,"17","1","23785717",Mixed,,"1",94.7098794338049,-13655579.8747468,5529986.26081861,-13655621.8581949,5530071.15693954

USACE works to address all types of flood risk associated with the dam. Dams have limited capacity to store water. Water may be released through the dam to manage water levels up or downstream or to relieve pressure on the dam to maintain its structural integrity. Severe weather events that bring inconsistent or larger amounts of water into the system can also lead to dam releases or in some cases overwhelm and lead to issues occurring at a dam. More detail related to this specific dam will be added at a future time.,"USACE manages dam-related flood risks by continually monitoring the condition and health of the dam, prioritizing activities that will most impact the risks, and engaging upstream and downstream emergency managers and members of the public to raise awareness of the dam and support actions to prepare and be ready to respond in the case of a dam-related emergency. USACE works closely with local emergency managers to share what is known about the dam and support the development of local emergency and evacuation plans. USACE regularly updates the emergency action plan for the dam. Regular maintenance and repairs are performed as needed to keep the dam functioning properly.

USACE completed a risk assessment on William L Jess Dam in 2017 that characterized the life-safety risks associated with the project as Moderate. The risk assessment found the risk to be driven by an unlikely scenario in which an extreme earthquake occurs at the same time reservoir elevations are the highest. In this scenario, an extreme earthquake causes the earthen dam to settle and crack, resulting in water over or through the dam.  The speed and depth of water flowing over and through the damaged dam could erode the soil and rock that forms the dam and cause significant flooding downstream. The strong shaking from such an earthquake could also damage the spillway’s concrete structure and gates, which could result in additional water flow in the river downstream. 

William L Jess Dam is located approximately 55 miles east of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, a megathrust fault along the Oregon Coast. The Cascadia Subduction Zone can produce very large, long duration earthquakes. The last Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake occurred in the year 1700.  

USACE is confident that the William L Jess Dam is well-built, well-maintained, and will continue to significantly reduce flood risks for the region. However, the dams cannot eliminate potential for flooding. Even with the presence of the flood risk management dams, extreme rainfall and snowmelt events may result in flooding in areas downstream of dams. Flooding can be caused by high flows resulting from unregulated portions of the watershed and/or high flow that must be passed through the dam outlets and spillways when reservoir storage capacities are exceeded.","The likelihood is low an extreme earthquake to occur that would severely damage William L Jess Dam, but the potential impacts of a dam failure are high due to the population downstream. USACE continues to evaluate the seismic performance of the embankment to determine if short-term targeted measures (called Interim Risk Reduction Measures), or long-term modifications will be necessary to reduce risk. USACE regularly conducts routine inspections of its dams and William L Jess Dam is equipped with instrumentation to monitor dam performance and seismic activity. Post-earthquake procedures are in place to inspect and evaluate earthquake damages and USACE conducts routine dam safety exercises with local Emergency Managers and first responders. William L Jess Dam’s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) outlines actions to be taken during an emergency.
